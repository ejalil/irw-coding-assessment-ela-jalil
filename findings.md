## Findings
**Key Findings:**
My analysis explored different aspects of 311 data including service type, location and a time-analysis. I first analyzed the 2024 data, and then performed the same analysis back to the 2015 data set to see if any trends in the data emerged. 

My first key finding was that the 311 request volume increased almost every year. In 2015, 298,414 requests were made. In 2024, 422,321 requests were made. This made me wonder if there was increased need, and if other public or private organizations would be able to help, or if people are now more comfortable with utilizing the 311 services. I saw that the app launched in 2012, and I contacted the Office of Unified Communications to see if that has had any impact on the increased call volume. The director emailed me that they are still putting together this information for me, so I was unable to include it in my findings. 

My second key finding is that the same zip codes were making the most requests every year. I did research into the income levels of each zip code to see if any patterns emerged. If I was reporting this story, I would go visit the areas that had the most frequent requests, and talk to the residents of that area. 

My final key finding is that the same services were in the top five most requested over a three-year period. Bulk collection, parking enforcement, illegal dumping and trash-related issues were what popped up most frequently from 2021-2024. Since illegal dumping is a felony, I am curious to know if the Department of Public Works is taking any aggressive measures within DCcommunities to prevent this from continuing. 

I wrote the first five paragraphs of my story, and would be able to complete the article with the reporting I outlined above. 

**First five paragraphs:** 

Over a 10-year period, the annual 311 city service request volume increased by over 100,000 in Washington, according to data collected by Open Data DC. 

The non-emergency line allows residents to schedule government services, report if any of the services were missed and other customer service related inquiries, the Office of Unified Communications website said. 

Bulk collection, parking enforcement and trash-related issues made up the most common requests to the 311 line. 

The Investigative Reporting Workshop analyzed 311 call data from 2015-2024 to document patterns in location and service type. The IRW found a steady increase between 2015, with around 300,000 documented requests, and 2024, with over 420,000 requests. 

The analysis also revealed that the same four zip codes: 20002, 20001, 20011 and 20019 repeatedly made the most calls over the past 10 years. According to Income by Zipcode, 20001 is the eighth wealthiest zip code in Washington.
